# Andrast
Generate a self signed SSL certificate

## How to run it 

If you wish to create a self sign certificate with a new key (a bit weak since it's only a 2048 bit long key) then type :

`./andrast create`

Or if you want to get the sha1 (weak again) of this create key then run :

`./andrast fingerprint`
